# This hack allows you to run make commands with any set of arguments.
#
# For example, these lines are the same:
#   > make g devise:install
#   > bundle exec rails generate devise:install
# And these:
#   > make add-migration add_deleted_at_to_users deleted_at:datetime
#   > bundle exec rails g migration add_deleted_at_to_users deleted_at:datetime
# And these:
#   > make add-model Order user:references record:references{polymorphic}
#   > bundle exec rails g model Order user:references record:references{polymorphic}
